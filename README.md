# React-TodoApp
Todo App built with react!

Notes-To Do is an application created to simplify the process of taking short notes or creating to do lists in the everyday life of an individual.

The reason this application came to mind when brainstorming, is that I needed an easy way of documenting my groceries. Using the old-fashioned pen and paper wasn’t going to work anymore and needed an upgrade. Whilst searching online for similar applications I realised the lack of simplicity; most applications had merged note pads and to do lists creating a more complicated design which isn’t easy to use in the spur of stressful situations.
